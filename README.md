# Stat of the art functional component

This project aims at demonstrating the use of Hooks in React 19. Zustand 5 and Redux 5 may be subsequently used.

We focus essentially on:
- useState
- useEffect
- useMemo
- useCallback
- useRef
- useReducer
- useContext

And on (re-)renderings.


## Run the project
